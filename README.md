# MyFlix

With the team at MyFlix, we recently decided to migrate from a DVD rental business to a mobile app with ads
where users can find movies to watch and add those to their wishlist.

We found your profile via Github and we think you are the most qualified to help.

We created wireframes of the final design for the mobile app.

To get information about movies you can use the https://www.themoviedb.org/ API

## Project features:

The mobile app should be able to interact with the backend for the following actions.

- Login/Logout
- Forgot password
- Sign up + Send a welcoming email
- Update my username or email
- Delete my account
- Search movies by language
- Search a movie by title
- Search movies by category
- List Categories
- Get details for a movie
- Sort movies by date (9 results by 9)
- List the crew of a movie by team
- List the casting of a movie
- Add a movie to my wishlist
- Remove a movie from my wishlist
- A user can only add/delete movies in own wishlist
- A user cannot add/delete movies in the wishlist of another user
- API Documentation using Swagger with this Django app https://drf-yasg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/readme.html.

Mobile app developers will start to build the app once the backend is completed.
To help them in the process to find proper requests to make.

## Deliverable

- Django project source code using python standards + testing
- Postman collection you can share with the mobile team

Good luck!
